# Connect-Four-Game

This is my version of the popular connect-four game.

Rules of game:
1. Only two players can play in this game.

2. Starting from the bottom, take turns to place balls in the grid.

3. The first player that connects four of their balls vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game!
